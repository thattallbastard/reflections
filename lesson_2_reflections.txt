What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git repository is created, which creates a .git folder in the directory that was initialized.
This is needed in order to store the metadata that tracks changes to the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where all of the files are currently stored.  The staging area is a place for git to place
files that are to be commited.  These files are still physically stored in the working directory. The value of the 
staging area is the ability to commit particular files rather than the whole directory at one time.
