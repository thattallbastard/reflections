When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The greatest need for a remote repository would be when you plan to have others collaborate on the project that you
are working on.  I could also see it being used as a backup storage option.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with others, they may have commited changes that you aren't ready to implement
on your local system yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are commits that are created after a certain point in the main project, but not a part of the main project.
They are mainly used to make changes without affecting the main project.  Clones make a copy of a project either from
a remote location, or locally.  Forks are clones that are done exclusively on GitHub.  They create a copy of a repository
on your GitHub profile.
