When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The greatest need for a remote repository would be when you plan to have others collaborate on the project that you
are working on.  I could also see it being used as a backup storage option.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with others, they may have commited changes that you aren't ready to implement
on your local system yet.
